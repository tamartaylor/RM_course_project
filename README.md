# RM_course_project: Eilat_Corals
Research Methods final 

Project Readme Note:
In my project I aim to investigate northern Red Sea corals along the depth gradient when my Research Objectives are:
•	Characterize benthic communities and their distribution along the depth gradient in the GoE/A.
•	To investigate the effect of light and photo-physiology on distribution of target species of hard corals. 
This study’s methods are conducted in two different methods by collecting data in-situ from which I will infer:
1.	Analyzing photo-quadrats to characterize the benthic distribution and coverage of few functional groups. 
2.	Analyzing photo-physiology activity of 5 hard corals with different depth preference: some depth-generalist and some depth-specific.
Hypothesis:
•	Benthic community's structure and distribution are influenced by depth and light availability.
•	The photo-physiology of corals from different species is depth-specific.

## 2024-07-07-qPCR 

The gene that I want to test by using qPCR, is Heat Shock protein 70 (HSP70) in branching coral *Stylophora pistillata*, the species that is in my proposal. The reason behind selecting this gene is that it has a role in regulating the susceptibility to thermal stresses of the coral, one of the most popular corals at the Red Sea. Coral bleaching and subsequent mortality is from the most serious threats to contemporary coral reefs and therefore, the cellular processes involved in the response of corals to the environmental stresses should be in now days research. HSP70 expression in response to bleaching, is species-specific. In *S. pistillata* is down-regulating. The reference gene I will use is *Ubiquitin.*

**The primers I found for the HSP70 gene are:**

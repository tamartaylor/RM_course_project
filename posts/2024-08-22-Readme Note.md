Project Readme Note:

In my project I aim to investigate northern Red Sea corals along the depth gradient when my Research Objectives are:

- Characterize benthic communities and their distribution along the depth gradient in the GoE/A.
- To investigate the effect of light and photo-physiology on distribution of target species of hard corals. 

This study’s methods are conducted in two different methods by collecting data in-situ from which I will infer:

1. Analyzing photo-quadrats to characterize the benthic distribution and coverage of few functional groups. 
1. Analyzing photo-physiology activity of 5 hard corals with different depth preference: <a name="_hlk145514479"></a>some depth-generalist and some depth-specific.

Hypothesis:

- Benthic community's structure and distribution are influenced by depth and light availability.
- The photo-physiology of corals from different species is depth-specific.
